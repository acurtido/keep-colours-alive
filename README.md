# Keep Colours Alive

My game, developed for the Ludum Dare 46 game jam, is a fast-paced puzzle game where the player has to save colourful creatures from dying by feeding them with the correct colour. The game is inspired by the theme "Keep it alive" and challenges the player to match the colour of the creature with the colour of the food, while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The game features cute graphics, and a simple but addictive gameplay. The game is suitable for all ages and can be played with a mouse and a keyboard.
